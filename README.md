# Data Structures and Algorithms Tasks

**ArrayList Operations:**
1. Create an ArrayList with 8 colors, display the contents.
2. Add a new element at position 2.
3. Update the element at position 3.
4. Check if "green" is present in the ArrayList.
5. Sort the ArrayList in alphabetical order (descending).
6. Reverse the order of elements in the ArrayList.
7. Swap the content of the ArrayList at the first and third positions, then display the final ArrayList.

**LinkedList Operations:**
1. Create a LinkedList with 7 elements of integer type, display the contents.
2. Add new elements at the beginning and end of the LinkedList (one element each).
3. Add a new element at position 3 in the LinkedList, display the contents.
4. Swap the content of LinkedList at positions 2 and 3.
5. Create a new LinkedList, add 3 elements of integer type, merge it with the manipulated LinkedList, and display the merged result.
6. Create a cloning of the last LinkedList (result of the merge).
7. Copy the content of the last LinkedList's last element to a variable, then display the variable and the LinkedList's content.

**Stack Management:**
- Implement stack management functions: isFull, isEmpty, pop, push. Refer to the flowchart for details.

**Sorting Algorithms:**
- Pseudocode for Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.

**Queue Operations:**
- Java program to calculate the average value and find the largest element using Priority Queue and Array Deque.

**Note:** Prioritize optimization and documentation for each operation. Enjoy exploring the wonders of data structures and algorithms!
